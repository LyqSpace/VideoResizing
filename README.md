# Video Resizing: A new robust framework.

The video resizing problem is that given a video and a target frame size. Resize the input video to the target frame size by content-aware analysis and mapping algorithm. The new video is supposed to keep the important content and the scene structure from the original video.

The state-of-the-art algorithms only focus on local features while ignore the global resized results’ optimization. Compared with the two main algorithms, Seam Carving and Image Warp, Our algorithm has two highlights: 1. A robust salient map detection which adapts to multiple scenes. 2. A new model resizes the video with better preservation of the important content and the scene structure.
